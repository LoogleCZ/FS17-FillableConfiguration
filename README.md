# Fillable configuration for FS17

This specialization adds configuration option in store for vehicle. Configuration covers specializations Fillable, FillVolume and Trailer. Full list of available nodes with example can be found in documentation.

Testers wanted! If you want to help me, you can use this script in your beta mods and test it. After testing, please report me any error or bug if you find some. It really helps me.

## Documentation

This script came with brief documentation where you can find how to install this script into your mod. Also you can find here a list of available nodes for configuration.

If you'll use this specialization, some validity checks of GE scripts will not work! Most important: *Fillable needs to be the first specialization which implements setIsFilling*. Tip for you: first create mod without configurations and then add Fillable Configuration only if there is no errors in log.
